For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA. Not only was it a great beer but really influenced my work for the next 5 years!\"Download our Best Practice IPA Solutions: https://lnkd.in/eyPXDm9r#lallemandbrewing #webrewwithyou #IPA #headytopper #thealchemistbrewery']\n",

Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA.

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA.

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA.

Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT.

It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations.

They can incorporate trace minerals within their cells - making them ideal to produce mineral-enriched yeast biomass.For instance, S. cerevisiae NCYC R397 (selenium-enriched yeast) represents an important source of organic selenium (Se) used in animal nutrition. During the fermentation process, Se is added to the fermentation medium, and yeasts can incorporate inorganic Se into their proteins in the form of organic seleno-amino acids (such as selenomethionine and selenocysteine).

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA. Not only was it a great beer but really influenced my work for the next 5 years!\"Download our Best Practice IPA Solutions: https://lnkd.in/eyPXDm9r#lallemandbrewing #webrewwithyou #IPA #headytopper #thealchemistbrewery', 'Want to know about Convergence-the industry leading product with yeast & enzymes united in a complete package? #LallemandBDS #Yeast #Fermentation #Convergence', \"Sharing out some interesting facts about #pizza:• Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal, while Lombardi’s in New York City was America’s first, in 1905.• An average American consumes 46 pizza slices in a single year.• The first frozen pizza hit the market in 1962.

During the fermentation process, Se is added to the fermentation medium, and yeasts can incorporate inorganic Se into their proteins in the form of organic seleno-amino acids (such as selenomethionine and selenocysteine).

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA. Not only was it a great beer but really influenced my work for the next 5 years!\"Download our Best Practice IPA Solutions: https://lnkd.in/eyPXDm9r#lallemandbrewing #webrewwithyou #IPA #headytopper #thealchemistbrewery', 'Want to know about Convergence-the industry leading product with yeast & enzymes united in a complete package? #LallemandBDS #Yeast #Fermentation #Convergence', \"Sharing out some interesting facts about #pizza:• Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal, while Lombardi’s in New York City was America’s first, in 1905.• An average American consumes 46 pizza slices in a single year.• The first frozen pizza hit the market in 1962.

They can incorporate trace minerals within their cells - making them ideal to produce mineral-enriched yeast biomass.For instance, S. cerevisiae NCYC R397 (selenium-enriched yeast) represents an important source of organic selenium (Se) used in animal nutrition. During the fermentation process, Se is added to the fermentation medium, and yeasts can incorporate inorganic Se into their proteins in the form of organic seleno-amino acids (such as selenomethionine and selenocysteine).

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA. Not only was it a great beer but really influenced my work for the next 5 years!\"Download our Best Practice IPA Solutions: https://lnkd.in/eyPXDm9r#lallemandbrewing #webrewwithyou #IPA #headytopper #thealchemistbrewery', 'Want to know about Convergence-the industry leading product with yeast & enzymes united in a complete package? #LallemandBDS #Yeast #Fermentation #Convergence', \"Sharing out some interesting facts about #pizza:• Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal, while Lombardi’s in New York City was America’s first, in 1905.• An average American consumes 46 pizza slices in a single year.• The first frozen pizza hit the market in 1962.

For this special day we asked Robert Percival, our Regional Manager in Europe, to tell us about his favorite IPA.\"In 2015 “New England IPA” or “Vermont IPA” had not yet reached Europe but there was a lot of talk across the Atlantic of an emerging new trend in IPA that was very different. Rather than the dry and clean west coast IPAs that had really dominated the IPA style in recent years these emerging east coast beers were much less bitter and selected more aromatic yeasts to work with hops to elevate a prominent aromatic profile. Heady Topper had an almost cult status of being the ‘original’ and reference beer for this style. It had a reputation for being incredibly rare, even locally in Vermont where fresh batches would sell out on the day it would be released to trade, so it was impossible to get outside of VT. When visiting for work I made it the mission to get some and was lucky enough that a local gave me two cans. I still remember the first sip very vividly. It was so smooth, drinkable and aromatic, like no other IPA I had before and exceeded my expectations. Suffice to say it blew my mind and started an obsession with finding the perfect yeasts for this style of modern IPA. Having this beer and experience had huge influence on the project that eventually led to us (Lallemand) in producing and releasing Lalbrew New England and later Verdant IPA. Not only was it a great beer but really influenced my work for the next 5 years!\"Download our Best Practice IPA Solutions: https://lnkd.in/eyPXDm9r#lallemandbrewing #webrewwithyou #IPA #headytopper #thealchemistbrewery', 'Want to know about Convergence-the industry leading product with yeast & enzymes united in a complete package? #LallemandBDS #Yeast #Fermentation #Convergence', \"Sharing out some interesting facts about #pizza:• Canada's first pizzeria opened in 1948, Pizzeria Napoletana in Montreal, while Lombardi’s in New York City was America’s first, in 1905.• An average American consumes 46 pizza slices in a single year.• The first frozen pizza hit the market in 1962.

They can incorporate trace minerals within their cells - making them ideal to produce mineral-enriched yeast biomass.For instance, S. cerevisiae NCYC R397 (selenium-enriched yeast) represents an important source of organic selenium (Se) used in animal nutrition. During the fermentation process, Se is added to the fermentation medium, and yeasts can incorporate inorganic Se into their proteins in the form of organic seleno-amino acids (such as selenomethionine and selenocysteine).
